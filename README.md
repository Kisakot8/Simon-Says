# Simon-Says
Simon Says game we were instructed to make in class. Meant to be a group project, got bored and did it myself.
Marcel is my partner for this project, but I got bored and did it myself.

This is just a fun lil game, nothing too special. Tutorial (included in program as well):

================ SIMON SAYS ================

Simon Says is a game of memory. The point of the game is to remember as many combinations of
colours as you can, which are displayed temporarily, one after another.

Here's an example:
The game tells you “Simon says Green… Red… Blue…” and then says GO! You then
have 2 seconds per colour (6 in this case) to type out the initials of the colours (i.e. GRB).
If you are correct, you move on to 4 colours, then 5, etc., but remember - only answer if Simon
says it, or you will lose. If the colours are not said by Simon, do not type anything and then
press enter.

There are 4 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Oh God. The difference between the first 3 is that
the time to view each colour is 2, 1.5 and 1 seconds (respectively). The last difficulty, Oh God, will
use 1 second of time and make each colour mismatched with its text, e.g. Blue (blue font) becomes Red
(blue font). Always type the colour of the text, not the colour printed. In this case, Typing B as the
answer is correct, even though the text says Red.


## Fun facts:
- First Python program in which I used:
  - Snake case (I know, sue me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
  - Type Hinting (VSCode made me do it)
  - List comprehensions (probably) (still barely understand them lol)
- Despite this, still too lazy to use classes and other OOP
- Could this code be neater? Eh. Maybe.
  - Do I care? Not really.
